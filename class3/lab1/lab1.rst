Welcome to the Telemetry Streaming course! In this course we will:

Explore F5 Telemetry Streaming, by using a declarative API model to forward, aggregate and analyze BIG-IP telemetry.

During this hands-on lab you will learn the following:

- How to use F5's declarative API to deploy applications via AS3. 

- How to use F5's declarative API to collect application statistics via Telemetry Streaming.

- How to use two data consumers to visualize statistics from Telemetry Streaming.

This lab will go through initial setup and add you to the Telemetry Streaming Agility 2020 workstation.  

Follow these steps to complete this lab:

**Exercise 1 - Setting Up Lab Workstation**
